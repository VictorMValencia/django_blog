# Django Blog App
Blog Application

https://djangoblogapp17.herokuapp.com/

I made a blog website using django to enhance my django knowledge and web development experience and deployed using heroku.
I will be using this app to build out more features that I may be interested in (ie post commenets, chat etc) 

The blog app has features:
User create/update
User Login 
User Profile photo 
User Password Reset with email
create/update/delete blog posts

I am working on getting AWS S3 for my static file stores
